	<a>Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.</a>
	<a>It is Toruk. Last Shadow.</a>
	<a>Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.</a>
	<a>My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto. Rider of Last Shadow.</a>
	<a>He rode this?</a>
	<a>Toruk chose him.</a>
	<a>It has only happened five times.</a> 
	<a>Since the time of the First Songs.</a>
	<a>That's a long time.</a>
	<a>Yes. Toruk Macto was mighty.</a> 
	<a>He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.</a> 
	<a>All Na'vi people know the story.</a>
	<a>Everything is backwards now.</a> 
	<a>Like out there is the true world and in here is the dream.</a>
	<a>It's hard to believe It's only been three months.</a>
	<a>I can barely remember my old life.</a>
	<a>I don't know who I am anymore.</a>
	<a>Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?</a> 
	<a>Your last report wasmore than two weeks ago.</a>
	<a>I'm starting to doubt your resolve!</a> 
	<a>The way I see it, It's time to terminate the mission.</a>
	<a>No, I can do this.</a>
	<a>You give me good, usable intel.</a>
	<a>I got them by the balls, whith that.</a>
	<a>When turns into a shirt fight, which it will.</a>
	<a>Now It's time to come in.</a>
	<a>By the way, you gonna get your legs back.</a>
	<a>I got your corporate approval.</a>
	<a>It's a done deal.</a>
	<a>Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.</a>
	<a>I'm a man of my word.</a>
	<a>I gotta finish this.</a>
	<a>There's one more thing.</a>
	<a>Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.</a>
	<a>If I do it, I'm one of them.</a>
	<a>And they'll trust me.</a> 
	<a>And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.</a>
	<a>Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.</a>
